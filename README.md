Several technologies, tools and languages were used in this project :
* HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript - ES6 (AJAX)
* PHP 7, SQL.

* API Google geocoding
* However, I mostly made this website thanks to **Symfony 5** & twig, composer, doctrine. 

## Summary

The main goal of this project is to create a website for horseowners and enthusiasts of the equestrian world.

The aim of this project is to offer to users a simple and innovative solution that will allow them to find a horse or a “borrower” according to their needs while offering a modern and accessible design.

For the visitor, the goal is to be able to see tenancies or profiles posts while being able to contact the author through a messaging system.

In brief, the main features for the website are the following:
* The user must be able to create an account and log in;
* The user must be able to create a profil or horse post according to his needs;
* The user must be able to run a post search on the website;
* The user must be able to like and comment these posts;
* And  finally, the user must be able to contact another user through a messaging system.

In addition, the purpose of this project is also to validate the professional title of "Web Developer" in ELAN Colmar school. 

First, the creation of several mock-up was necessary as well as the data conceptualization (MLC / MLD).

Then, the front-end as well as the back-end skills were used during the development of the website.

Finally, the constant use of English, the compliance with security standards as well as the technology watch also played an important role during the development of this project.

Special thanks to my teachers : Stéphane Smail, Gilles Muess, Cindy Cahen, Mickael Murmann and Virgile Gibello.
